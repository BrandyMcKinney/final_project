GiveTo is essentially a charity organizer. This is my very first project that I created for my capstone project. It is fully deployed using Heroku and  Netlify and should be functioning. Please note I do continue to use this app as a learning tool on occasion so it may be possible that parts may not be fully functioning. In any case thank you for checking out my app, GiveTo.

What's it all about?

The user is able to create an account and maintain a list of charities they may wish to donate to. The idea being that many people/organizations are in need of help and this app could potentionally reduce overwhelm for the giver. It would also serve as a memory tool.  

The user can scroll through a list of charities, select a charity, and input donation frequency and amount.

The user also has a fun option of randomly selected a charity that they wish to donate to.

This is a simple app but helpful tool to organize charities.
